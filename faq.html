  <details>
    <summary>What age group is this camp for?</summary>
    <p>Coderpillars is designed for kids ages <strong>7 to 12</strong>. If you have a child outside of these boundaries whose skill level matches a typical 7–12 year old, contact me to discuss.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>Where is the camp located?</summary>
    <p>Camp takes place at my house which is located in <strong>Coles Crossing</strong> (Cypress, TX). You’ll receive the address in your confirmation email after registering.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What are the camp hours?</summary>
    <p>Each session runs for <strong>3 hours a day, 4 days a week</strong> (Monday through Thursday). You’ll be able to choose between AM (9:00–12:00) and PM (1:00–4:00) sessions during registration.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Does my child need any coding experience?</summary>
    <p><strong>Nope</strong>! I teach children of all experience levels.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Does my child need to bring their own laptop, and if so, what specifications are needed?</summary>
    <p>You can choose to rent a laptop of mine for the week for a $20 fee, or you can bring your own (recommended). I have a limited number of rental laptops which will be reserved for the first students who opt for them on the registration form and make payment.</p>
    <p>If you bring your own laptop, it must meet these requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Laptops must run Windows or Mac. <strong>Chromebooks (aka the ones issued for school) are not allowed</strong> as they cannot run our coding software.</li>
      <li>Laptops must have the storage available to download minimal software that will depend on the camp. As long as your storage isn’t completely full, you should be good to go.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Do you provide snacks?</summary>
    <p>All students are strongly encouraged to bring their own snack as there will be a brief snack break halfway through the camp. Upon parental approval, I may give your child an occasional treat/candy. Allergies and dietary restrictions are to be specified on the registration form.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What kinds of activities will my child do?</summary>
    <p>The specific activities will depend on the camp offered that week, but all camps will include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Beginner-friendly coding lessons</li>
      <li>Fun science experiments</li>
      <li>Other creative, hands-on activities, such as crafts and games</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I make sure to keep screen time balanced with movement, exploration, and creativity.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How many kids are in each camp session?</summary>
    <p>Each group will have <strong>up to 8 kids</strong> to ensure a fun, focused experience with lots of personal attention.</p>
  </details>
  <details>

    <p>Yes, each sibling after the first gets $15 off!</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What’s your sick/absence policy?</summary>
    <p>If your child is ill, please keep them home for the safety of everyone. If your child can’t make their AM session due to a commitment, they can attend the PM session instead, or vice versa. Just let me know ahead of time. Missed days will not be refunded.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Will you be taking photos?</summary>
