    <section id="faq">

  <details>
    <summary>What age group is this camp for?</summary>
    <p>Coderpillars is designed for kids ages <strong>7 to 12</strong>. If you have a child outside of these boundaries whose skill level matches a typical 7‚Äì12 year old, contact me to discuss.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>Where is the camp located?</summary>
    <p>Camp takes place at my house which is located in <strong>Coles Crossing</strong> (Cypress, TX). You‚Äôll receive the address in your confirmation email after registering.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What are the camp hours?</summary>
    <p>Each session runs for <strong>3 hours a day, 4 days a week</strong> (Monday through Thursday). You‚Äôll be able to choose between AM (9:00‚Äì12:00) and PM (1:00‚Äì4:00) sessions during registration.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
    <p>The cost of the camp which runs 3 hours a day, 4 days a week is $125. Payment instructions will be sent after registration.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Does my child need any coding experience?</summary>
    <p><strong>Nope</strong>! I teach children of all experience levels.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Does my child need to bring their own laptop, and if so, what specifications are needed?</summary>
    <p>You can choose to rent a laptop of mine for the week for a $20 fee, or you can bring your own (recommended). I have a limited number of rental laptops which will be reserved for the first students who opt for them on the registration form and make payment.</p>
    <p>If you bring your own laptop, it must meet these requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Laptops must run Windows or Mac. <strong>Chromebooks (aka the ones issued for school) are not allowed</strong> as they cannot run our coding software.</li>
      <li>Laptops must have the storage available to download minimal software that will depend on the camp. As long as your storage isn‚Äôt completely full, you should be good to go.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Do you provide snacks?</summary>
    <p>All students are strongly encouraged to bring their own snack as there will be a brief snack break halfway through the camp. Upon parental approval, I may give your child an occasional treat/candy. Allergies and dietary restrictions are to be specified on the registration form.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What kinds of activities will my child do?</summary>
    <p>The specific activities will depend on the camp offered that week, but all camps will include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Beginner-friendly coding lessons</li>
      <li>Fun science experiments</li>
      <li>Other creative, hands-on activities, such as crafts and games</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I make sure to keep screen time balanced with movement, exploration, and creativity.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How many kids are in each camp session?</summary>
    <p>Each group will have <strong>up to 8 kids</strong> to ensure a fun, focused experience with lots of personal attention.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Do you offer a sibling discount?</summary>
    <p>Yes, each sibling after the first gets $15 off!</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What‚Äôs your sick/absence policy?</summary>
    <p>If your child is ill, please keep them home for the safety of everyone. If your child can‚Äôt make their AM session due to a commitment, they can attend the PM session instead, or vice versa. Just let me know ahead of time. Missed days will not be refunded.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Will you be taking photos?</summary>
    <p>I sometimes take photos during camp to share with parents or for promotional purposes. You‚Äôll have an opportunity to opt in or out during registration.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What payment methods do you take?</summary>
    <p>I accept payments through Venmo, Zelle, and PayPal. Cash is also accepted.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>When is payment due?</summary>
    <p>Once the registration form is completed, you will receive payment instructions. Please note: your child's spot in camp is not secured until payment is received.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What should my child bring to camp each day?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Snack (to be eaten halfway through the 3-hour camp)</li>
      <li>Full water bottle (refills will be available during camp)</li>
      <li>Laptop & laptop charger (if you aren‚Äôt renting one of mine)</li>
    </ul>
